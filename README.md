# SleepWell: Become the Dreamy One  

Welcome to *SleepWell*, a solo-developed system where all AI runs locally, offering a gamified well-being experience where you become **The Dreamy One** ‚Äî a mindful sleeper assisted by four mystical companions.

> Explore. Reflect. Rest. Repeat.

## TL;DR for Judges

- **SleepWell** is a solo-built, full-stack wellness experience that turns sleep improvement into a magical adventure ‚Äî complete with quests, XP, calming rituals, bedtime stories, and AI insights.

- **Local AI-first: All core ML**  including webcam emotion recognition (OpenCV + DeepFace), journal sentiment analysis (Hugging Face), and a custom sleep score model ‚Äî runs fully offline in both branches, ensuring privacy and responsiveness. Only the routine advisor LLM differs between branches (local vs Hugging Face API).

- **LLM-Powered Routine Advisor**: Get personalized tips from a smart language AI (Hugging Face API in main branch, local FLAN-T5 in offline branch)

- **Gamified Companions**: Choose between four mystical guides ‚Äî The Sage, The Knight, The Healer, and The Tracker ‚Äî each unlocking unique quests, habit tracking, breathing tools, calming games, and reflective journaling.

> A deeply integrated blend of AI, emotional intelligence, and habit-forming UX ‚Äî made by one developer under time pressure and while unwell.

|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend              | React, Vite, Firebase Auth, CSS3                              |
| Backend               | Flask, Firestore (Firebase DB), Firebase Admin SDK, Hugging Face Transformers |
| Push Notifications    | Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) *(partially integrated)*       |
| Image Processing      | OpenCV for webcam image capture and preprocessing             |
| Emotion Detection     | Pretrained facial emotion classifier model (via OpenCV input) |
| Sentiment Analysis    | Hugging Face transformers (on journal entries)                |
| Sleep Score Prediction| Custom ML model combining mood, journal sentiment, webcam emotion |
| Routine Tip Generation| Zephyr-7B (Hugging Face API main branch) or FLAN-T5 (local)   |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Judge Setup Note (Important)

Due to the use of local AI models and specific environment requirements, the backend may not run immediately without setup:

- Requires **Python 3.11.8** (to support certain model dependencies)
- Use of a **virtual environment is strongly recommended**

---
## Run Locally

### Frontend
git clone [(https://github.com/KaranMishra3610/SleepWell.git)](https://github.com/KaranMishra3610/SleepWell.git)
cd frontend  
npm install  
npm run dev


###  Backend
cd backend  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python app.py

You‚Äôll also need:  
- Firebase service account key  
- Firebase project for Auth, FCM, Firestore  
- Hugging Face API key (for LLM-based tips)  
- Python packages: OpenCV, transformers  

---

## Future Scope
This was just the beginning. Here's what could be added next:  
- Backend Deployment with live endpoints  
- Final UI Enhancements ‚Äì animations, transitions  
- More Mini-Games ‚Äì rhythm-based or calming puzzles  
- PWA Support ‚Äì installable mobile app with vibration/audio  
- LLM Companion Dialogues ‚Äì emotional support through smart conversations

## Learnings
-- This individual project challenged me to merge bleeding-edge tech with emotional UX design within real-world limitations. Here are some takeaways:  

- Full-Stack Product Thinking ‚Äì Architecting a wellness app from ground up, start to finish  
- ML + UX Integration ‚Äì Mapping ML predictions to actual user interactions and feedback  
- Natural Language Prompt Engineering ‚Äì Engineered prompts that provide actionable recommendations from LLMs  
- Webcam-Based Emotion Detection ‚Äì Recorded real-time emotional context with OpenCV + pretrained models  
- Sentiment & Mood Modeling ‚Äì Examined journal entries and mood through various NLP techniques  
- Firebase Auth & Secure Token Handling ‚Äì Implemented secure backend routes with ID token verification  
- XP & Quest Systems ‚Äì Built game-inspired systems that monitor user behavior and activity  
- State Management & UI Feedback Loops ‚Äì Managed async data flows between backend, ML, and frontend layers  
- Rapid Solo Prototyping ‚Äì Had to provide a full-featured experience under a time constraint and while ill  

- This project wasn't merely about creating features ‚Äî it was about crafting a wellness experience that feels fun, individual, and transformative.
